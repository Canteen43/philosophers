Concerning fork distribution, even numbers of philosophers are easy:
First the odds can eat, then the evens.

With odd numbers of philosophers it is harder. But my idea is:
First the odds can eat, except the last one.
From the eating rotates one position further every time.
So in round 2 the evens can eat.
In round 3 the odds can eat, except the first one.
And so on.
There will be different combinations equal to the number of philosophers.
Wait time between eating will mostly be one eating duration and sometimes 
two eating durations.

How do I solve the printing problem?:
- chatgpt says that mutexes do the trick
- I am allowed to use printf

Can philosophers die while eating?
- Yes they can. Time_to_die counts from start of meal to start of meal

Attention!
- I have to handle negative or zero arguments.
