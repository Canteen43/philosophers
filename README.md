# Philosophers

A multithreading simulation that solves the classic dining philosophers problem using mutexes and threads to prevent deadlock and starvation.

## Overview

This project implements the classic dining philosophers problem, a fundamental synchronization problem in computer science. The simulation demonstrates concurrent programming concepts including thread management, mutex usage, and deadlock prevention.

## The Problem

Philosophers sit around a circular table with forks between them. Each philosopher needs two forks to eat, but there are only as many forks as philosophers. The challenge is to prevent deadlock and starvation while allowing philosophers to eat, think, and sleep.

## Features

- **Thread Management:** Each philosopher runs in its own thread
- **Mutex Synchronization:** Forks are protected by mutexes
- **Deadlock Prevention:** Algorithms to prevent circular waiting
- **Death Detection:** Monitors philosopher health and terminates on death
- **Configurable Parameters:** Adjustable timing and philosopher count

## Usage

```bash
make
./philo [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [optional: number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]
```

### Parameters
- `number_of_philosophers` - Number of philosophers (and forks)
- `time_to_die` - Time in ms before a philosopher dies without eating
- `time_to_eat` - Time in ms it takes to eat
- `time_to_sleep` - Time in ms spent sleeping
- `number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat` - Optional stop condition

### Example
```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200 3
```

## Implementation

The solution uses:
- **Pthread library** for thread creation and management
- **Mutex locks** for fork synchronization
- **Timing functions** for precise sleep and death detection
- **Shared memory** for philosopher state monitoring

## Output

The program displays timestamped actions:
```
[timestamp] philosopher_id is eating
[timestamp] philosopher_id is sleeping
[timestamp] philosopher_id is thinking
[timestamp] philosopher_id died
```

## Termination

The simulation ends when:
- A philosopher dies from starvation
- All philosophers have eaten the required number of times (if specified)
